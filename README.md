# Thesis
Bunch of scripts and pipelines that I "designed" for my Bioinformatics project thesis.

# Temporary Index
1.) flanking_updated.py : A Python script to fetch flanking sequences surrounding miRNA hits in a genome reference and creating a precursor '.fasta' file containing the appropriate left flank + miRNA motiif (the hit sequence) + right flank sequence.  

## TODO
Update stuff here and there, include a humanly-readable index and friendlier variable names.
Also, comment the code better.
